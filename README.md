Introduction

PdfExtractor can extract information, including text, text position and image info, from a pdf file.
By far, the PdfExtractor is only compatible with the version before PDF 1.4, where the crossreference
    table (instead of crossreference stream) is used.
I'm still working on it and it might support crossreference stream very soon.

How to use:

Run Main.java and follow the instruction. Then just type in the pathname of the PDF file you want to
extract information from. Your report will be in a file called report.txt in the same folder as the source code.
